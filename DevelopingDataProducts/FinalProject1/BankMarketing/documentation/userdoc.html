<h1 id="intro">Introduction</h1>

<p> This application allows the user to view the effects of different variables on the predicted likelihood of success of a marketing campaign.

<h1 id="details">Details</h1>

<p><strong>Prediction Input</strong> <br>
In the panel on the left, you can choose which values to use in the prediction:</p>

<ul>
<li>The outcome of the last marketing campaign</li>
<li>The number of contacts to the customer during that campaign</li>
<li>The number of contacts to the customer during the current campaign</li>
<li>The customer's age</li>
<li>The customer's average yearly balance (euros)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Prediction Rendering</strong> <br>
As you make selections in the left panel, a prediction, which is a probability of success, is generated and displayed in two ways in the panel on the right.  First, a color gradient scale is shown to represent the probability, between 0 and 1, with lower values on the left and increasing to the right.  The actual prediction is represented as a black dot on that scale.  Additionally, the actual predicted probability is displayed as a reference.</p>

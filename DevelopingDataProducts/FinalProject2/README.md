#Introduction

This repository contains the artifacts for the final project for the Coursera Developing Data Products course.  The application and associated "pitch" presentation are for a "Precision Coaching" application that could allow a properly equipped physical therapist or strength coach to train a patient to perform an exercise (such as a dumbbell curl) in a prescribed manner and then visually, and possibly mathematically, track the patient's adherence to the "model".

##Precision Medicine
"Until now, most medical treatments have been designed for the “average patient.” As a result of this “one-size-fits-all” approach, treatments can be very successful for some patients but not for others. Precision Medicine, on the other hand, is an innovative approach that takes into account individual differences in people’s genes, environments, and lifestyles. It gives medical professionals the resources they need to target the specific treatments of the illnesses we encounter, further develops our scientific and medical research, and keeps our families healthier" <sup>1</sup>.

##Precision Coaching
Like precision medicine, learning specific things about an athlete or patient can help a physician or coach tailor instruction to an individual.  There have been many studies of physical motion in athletes, in everything from golf swings to rugby pitches, and many activities in between.  However, studies like the one done by [Veloso](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/work.jsf?p1=11201) show promise in performing more detailed qualitative analysis of human activity.  I believe this can be applied to fields of medicine and specifically physical therapy or any rehabilitative medicine where range and quality of motion is the primary goal.

##Application

The application in this repository is simply a visualization of the some of the data from [Veloso](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/work.jsf?p1=11201), specifically the locations in three-dimensional space of the sensors used on the various body locations while the test subjects performed the dumbbell curl correctly and incorrectly in various ways.  However, this simple visualization, I believe, demonstrates how data could be compared over time from a baseline for a single patient, during physical therapy.   This also seems to be consistent with the model based approach the study used in the end to build their application for more general purposes.
